# Question Set 1

**Leap Year Check:**
Write a Python program that takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year. This program should use conditions to determine if a year is divisible by 4, not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400.  
*Example:* If the input year is 2020, the output should be "2020 is a leap year."

**Even or Odd Check:**
Write a Python program that takes a number as input and checks if it is even or odd. This program should use the modulus operator to determine if the number is even or odd and print the result.  
*Example:* If the input number is 7, the output should be "7 is odd."

**Print Numbers 1 to 10:**
Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop. This program should use a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to 10 and print each number.  
*Example:* The output should be "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10".

**Multiples of 5:**
Write a Python program that prints the first 10 multiples of 5 using a for loop. This program should use a for loop to generate and print the first 10 multiples of 5.  
*Example:* The output should be "5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50".

**Multiplication Table:**
Write a Python program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10. This program should prompt the user to enter a number and use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number.  
*Example:* If the input number is 3, the output should be "3 x 1 = 3, 3 x 2 = 6, 3 x 3 = 9, ..., 3 x 10 = 30".

**Fibonacci Series:**
Write a Python program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.  
*Example:* The output should be "0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34".

**Nth Fibonacci Number:**
Write a Python program that takes a number \( n \) as input and prints the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.  
*Example:* If the input \( n \) is 6, the output should be "The 6th Fibonacci number is 5".

**Factorial:**
Write a Python program that takes a number as input and prints its factorial. This program should prompt the user to enter a number and use a loop or recursion to calculate and print the factorial of that number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.  
*Example:* If the input number is 5, the output should be "The factorial of 5 is 120".

**Factorial Using a Loop:**
Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number using a for loop. This program should use a for loop to calculate the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.  
*Example:* If the input number is 4, the output should be "The factorial of 4 is 24".

**Sum of Digits:**
Write a Python program that takes a number as input and prints the sum of its digits. This program should prompt the user to enter a number and use a loop or arithmetic operations to calculate and print the sum of its digits.  
*Example:* If the input number is 123, the output should be "The sum of the digits of 123 is 6".

**Sum of Digits Using a Loop:**
Write a Python program to find the sum of digits of a given number using a for loop. This program should use a for loop to iterate over the digits of a number and calculate their sum.  
*Example:* If the input number is 456, the output should be "The sum of the digits of 456 is 15".

**String Palindrome Check:**
Write a Python program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. This program should prompt the user to enter a string and use string manipulation to determine and print whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.  
*Example:* If the input string is "madam", the output should be "madam is a palindrome".

**Number Palindrome Check:**
Write a Python program that takes a number as input and checks if it is a palindrome. This program should prompt the user to enter a number and use arithmetic operations or string manipulation to determine and print whether the number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.  
*Example:* If the input number is 121, the output should be "121 is a palindrome".

**Prime Number Check:**
Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is prime. This program should prompt the user to enter a number and use a loop to determine and print whether the number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  
*Example:* If the input number is 11, the output should be "11 is a prime number".

**Print Prime Numbers:**
Write a Python program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 50. This program should use a loop and conditionals to find and print all prime numbers between 1 and 50.  
*Example:* The output should be "2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47".

**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. This program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and use the Euclidean algorithm to calculate and print their GCD. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.  
*Example:* If the input numbers are 48 and 18, the output should be "The GCD of 48 and 18 is 6".

**Sum of Natural Numbers:**
Write a Python program that takes a number \( n \) as input and prints the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. This program should prompt the user to enter a number \( n \) and use a loop or formula to calculate and print the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers.  
*Example:* If the input number is 10, the output should be "The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is 55".
